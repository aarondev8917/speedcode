AN INT will always be 4 bytes no matter the length specified.
- TINYINT = 1 byte (8 bit)
- SMALLINT = 2 bytes (16 bit)
- MEDIUMINT = 3 bytes (24 bit)
- INT = 4 bytes (32 bit)
- BIGINT = 8 bytes (64 bit).

The length just specifies how many characters to display when selecting data with the mysql command line client.
maximum value will be 2147483647 (Signed) 2^32 / 2
or 4294967295 (Unsigned) 2^32
