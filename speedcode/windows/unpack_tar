If you have MinGW/MSYS or Cygwin installed, you can use the tar command to unpack such files:
 tar xvf  <.tar file>
 tar xzvf <.tar.gz file>
 tar xjvf <.tar.bz2 file>
(can be used for linux as well)


To extract all files in a folder
tar xvf support-2015-10-19.tar -C <directory>
directory needs to be created first
